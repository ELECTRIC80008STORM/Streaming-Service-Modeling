# Streaming Service Modeling
This is going to be a simple modeling system for a streaming service. The system is going to focus on showing movies and series (as titles or names for now).

## Context
In recent years, low-cost, on-demand streaming services like Netflix, Disney, and DC have gained immense popularity. Some characteristics our limited support version must have in order to support a future content provider for these kinds of services are:
- Being able to manage two types of videos, movies and series.
- Every video must have an ID, a name, a length, and genre.
- Series must have episodes and each episode needs to have a title and a season to which it belongs to.
- Videos need to show the ratings they have received, it can go from 1 to 5 (5 being the best rating).

And the computational system (what it’s presented to the user) needs to be able to:
Show the collection of videos by title, and give more information when prompted by the user.
- Show the episodes for a given series, along with their ratings.
- Show the movies.

## Why it’s interesting
As a project, I find it interesting because it allows me to work as if it was a request given by an employer, meaning, I sort of get to experience how would it be to work on a code task given by someone else, instead of creating the project and tasks by myself (of which I can choose the difficulty).
